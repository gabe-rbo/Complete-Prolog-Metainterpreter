# The Metainterpreter

This is a complete prolog metainterpreter, meaning it executes all possible programs, including those with cuts and builtins.
There are 2 versions in the MIs folder:
- MI1 executes only conjunction clauses but doesn't cut.
- MI is the complete SWI-Prolog metainterpreter, which executes cuts, builtins and metainterpret iself "infinitely"

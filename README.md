# The Metainterpreter

This is a complete prolog metainterpreter, meaning it executes all possible programs, including those with cuts and builtins.
There are 2 items in the MIs folder:
- MI is the complete SWI-Prolog metainterpreter, which executes cuts, builtins and metainterpret istelf "infinitely";
- test_tool is a test tool for you to experiment my meta-interpreter freely.
